# May The FOSS Be With You

> A Beginner's Guide to Open Source with Node

This is a talk I gave at the [Atlanta Node.js meetup on Jan. 21, 2016](http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Nodejs-Developers/events/226261192/).

The presentation was recorded, but I don't think it's been published yet.

The slides were created in Keynote, exported to HTML, and pushed here.

Disclaimer: I'm terrible at design and picking colors, as demonstrated here, but
hopefully you don't find the slides too boring. :)
